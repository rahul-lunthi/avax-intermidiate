# Solidity Error Handling Example

This repository demonstrates the use of various error handling techniques in Solidity, including `require`, `revert`, `assert`, and custom error definitions. The purpose is to provide a practical guide for developers new to blockchain and smart contract development, highlighting how to manage exceptions and errors in their code effectively.

# Description

The Solidity Error Handling Example includes a set of functions designed to showcase different ways to handle errors and unexpected inputs in a smart contract. The contract includes:
- Validations using `require` that ensure inputs meet certain conditions before proceeding.
- Use of `revert` to undo all changes when conditions are not met.
- `assert` to check for invariants within the contract.
- Custom errors for more detailed and specific error handling. 

These functionalities are crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain.
