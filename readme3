# MEMECOIN ERC20 Token

A simple ERC20 token implementation named MEMECOIN (`MEME`). This project provides a straightforward example of creating an ERC20 standard token in Solidity, suitable for educational purposes or as a starting point for more complex applications.

# Description
Welcome to the Ethereum blockchain! This Solidity code represents a basic implementation of an ERC-20 token, a standard interface for fungible tokens on the Ethereum platform. This contract provides the foundation for creating and managing your own digital assets.
Overview

This ERC-20 token contract includes the following features:

    Name: MyToken
    Symbol: MYT
    Decimals: 18
    Total Supply: Defined during contract deployment

# Contract Details
Functions

    Constructor:
        Initializes the token with a specified name, symbol, decimals, and initial supply.

    Minting Function:
        Allows the contract owner to mint new tokens and assign them to a specified address.

    Transfer Function:
        Enables token transfers from the sender to a specified address.

    Approval Function:
        Allows the token owner to approve another address to spend tokens on their behalf.

    Transfer From Function:
        Permits an approved address to transfer tokens from one address to another.

# Owner Management

    The contract includes an owner, and certain functions can only be executed by the owner (onlyOwner modifier).

# Getting Started

    Deploy the contract to the Ethereum blockchain.
    Interact with the contract using Ethereum-compatible wallets or DApps.

# Usage

    Mint new tokens using the mint function.
    Transfer tokens using the transfer function.
    Approve spending on your behalf with the approve function.
    Transfer tokens from one address to another using the transferFrom function.

# Security Considerations

    Ensure the owner address is secure and kept private.
    Review and test thoroughly before deploying to the Ethereum mainnet.
